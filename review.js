Let's do some review of yesterday. 

this exercise will be like the table you built.
[{
	person: "Tom Cruise"
	likesTacos: "no"
	},
{




Construct an unordered list of react elements. 
Make a parent component and a child component. 
The parent component will make render an unordered list
of child components. 

Use this array 

[
  {
    person:"Tom Cruise",
    likesTacos:"no"
  }, 
  {
    person:"Andrew Jackson",
    likesTacos:"never knew what tacos were"
  },
  {
    person:"Rand Paul",
    likesTacos:"yes"
  }
]

to pass each element in the array to the child components and have them
render {person}: {likesTacos}

so the html page will show


Tom Cruise: no
Andrew Jackson: never knew what tacos were
Rand Paul: yes
