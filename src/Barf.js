import React, { Component } from 'react';

//Create another react component the same way as you did before
//This time, we're going to use this component WITHIN your other 
//component - that's right, we can nest components. Call the component
// "Barf"

//export it in this file, then import it into your index.js file and put the tag
//inside the div's in your render method and viola!
