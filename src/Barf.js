import React, { Component } from 'react';

//Let's build a react component from scratch

//step 1: build a class, call it w/e you want
//step 2: make it a subclass of "React.Component"
//step 3: give it a render() method
//step4: within the render method, return an opening
//and closing div tag. Wrap it withiin a set of parens
// Throw some html inside of there




//We're going to use this component WITHIN your other 
//component - that's right, we can nest components. 

//export it in this file, then import it into your App.js file and put the tag
//inside the div's somewhere in your render method and viola! 
//Look at your hard work in the browser
